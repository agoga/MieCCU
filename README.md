# MieCCU
This project simulates the scattering of microwaves off a lattice of metal spheres to investigate Bragg scattering. It uses an open source single sphere scattering program(http://scatterlib.wikidot.com/mie python version). MeiCCU handles geometric and interference calculations to extend scattering results from single spheres to a lattice. Numbers used are designed to show the Bragg scattering phenomenon 

#MeiPy
This folder holds my attempted port of single sphere scattering algorithm developed in "Absorption and scattering of light by small particles" by Craig Bohren and Donald Huffman. Also holds original single sphere scattering taken from scatterlib as reference against my changes.
